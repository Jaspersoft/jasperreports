/**
 * Groups several report elements. Report elements placed in any report section can be arranged in multiple
 * nested groups. The only reason you might have for grouping your elements is to be able to customize the
 * stretch behavior of the report elements.
 * <p/>
 * One possible value of the <code>stretchType</code> attribute, available for all report elements, is
 * <code>RelativeToTallestObject</code>. If you choose this option, the engine tries to identify the
 * object from the same group as the current graphic element that has suffered the biggest
 * amount of stretch. It will then adapt the height of the current report element to the height
 * of this tallest element of the group.
 * <p/>
 * However, for this to work, you must group your elements. To do this, use the
 * <code>&lt;elementGroup&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/elementGroup&gt;</code> tags to mark the elements that 
 * are part of the same group.
 * <p/>
 * Report sections are element groups themselves, so all report elements placed directly in a
 * containing band are part of the same default element group, which is the band itself. As
 * such, for these report elements, <code>stretchType="RelativeToTallestObject"</code> and
 * <code>stretchType= "RelativeToBandHeight"</code> have the same effect.
